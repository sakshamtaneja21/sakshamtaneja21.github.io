                This code of conduct outlines our expectations for members within this community. We are committed to
                providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all and expect our code of conduct to be honored.

                <ul>
                    Be friendly and patient.
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    Be welcoming: We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and
                    identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national
                    origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual
                    orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion,
                    and mental and physical ability.
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    Be respectful: Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor
                    behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot
                    allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community
                    where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    Abusive Language: Such Language should be avoided as much as posssible.

                    We encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a community for all. Although we
                    will fail at times, we seek to treat everyone both as fairly and equally as possible. Whenever a
                    member made a mistake, we expect them to take responsibility for it. If someone has been harmed or
                    offended, it is our responsibility to listen carefully and respectfully, and do our best to right
                    the wrong. </br>Although this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honor diversity in age,
                    gender, gender identity or expression, culture, ethnicity, language, national origin, political
                    beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and technical
                    ability. We will not tolerate discrimination based on any of the protected characteristics above.
